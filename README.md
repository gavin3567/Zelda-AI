# **The Coolest Neural Network**

heck ya bois this is gonna be great.


so I've gotten started with some stuff. Took like 5 hours to figure out what I wanted to do and how to set it up, but we got it working.

using openAI's gym and an emulator called fceux, we can get some code to play zelda.


### **How to use**

I'm not sure what you're goign to have to do to get this to work. I'll run through it with reid and see how it goes for him.

1. try to open the emulator 
   ```shell
     cd .\emulator\fceux-2.6.5-win32
     .\fceux.exe

2. try to open the game
   - file -> open -> emulator -> LegendOfZelda-Nes.nes
3. run the test script
    - file -> lua -> new lua script window -> .\luaScripts\test.lua
    - press run, and it should start walking around and stuff
4. take a look at the main script.
